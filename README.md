Context
This data set was collected with the original goal of training an embedded device to perform real-time animal detection in nature reserves in South Africa.

Content
The data was collected using the following steps:

Perform a Google search on the image class.
Manually download images that are good representations of the class.
Manually label the images in the YOLO format
Yeah â€¦. there was a lot of manual labor involved, but what can you do!
Four animal classes commonly found in nature reserves in South Africa are represented in this data set: buffalo, elephant, rhino and zebra. See the images below for examples.


This data set contains at least 376 images for each animal class collected via Google's image search function and labelled for object detection. Each example in the data set consists of a jpg image and a txt label file. The images have differing aspect ratios and contain at least one example of the specified animal class. Multiple instances of animals can exist in a single image. There could also be occurrences of the other classes in the same image, e.g. a zebra(3) in the file with an elephant(1).
